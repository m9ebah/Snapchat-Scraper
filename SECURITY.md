## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure. 
If you identify a vulnerability, please report it to us through [email/security contact].

### Reporting Guidelines:
- Provide a clear and detailed description of the issue.
- Include steps to reproduce the vulnerability, if possible.
- Do not disclose the issue publicly until we have addressed it.

We will acknowledge receipt of your report and work to resolve the issue promptly. 

Thank you for helping us keep our project secure.
